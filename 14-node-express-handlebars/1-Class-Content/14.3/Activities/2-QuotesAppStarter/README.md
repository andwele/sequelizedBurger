  * **Instructions**

    * Using Express, MySQL, Handlebars, and the starter code which was slacked out to you as a jumping-off point, you will be creating a simple web application which allows users to create, read, update, and delete popular quotes.

    * Your application will have two pages:

      * One will show all of the quotes within a database and will allow users to create a new quote or delete an existing one. A button next to each, labeled "Update This Quote," will take users to the other page which shows the quote selected and will allow them to update it with new information.

    * Make sure to run the code contained within the `schema.sql` and `seeds.sql` files beforehand so that you have a database with which to work.
