### 11. Partners Do: Ben and Jerry's App (15 minutes)

**Instructions**

* In this activity, you are going to be creating your own Ben and Jerry's App where users can see all of the different flavors Ben and Jerry's have to offer while also getting specific information on a flavor by searching for it within the URL.
```
var icecreams = [
	{name: 'vanilla', price: 10, awesomeness: 3},
	{name: 'chocolate', price: 4, awesomeness: 8},
	{name: 'banana', price: 1, awesomeness: 1},
	{name: 'greentea', price: 5, awesomeness: 7},
	{name: 'jawbreakers', price: 6, awesomeness: 2},
];
```
* Do not use MySQL for this assignment! Use the `icecreams` variable above as your data. Add the variable to your `server.js` file.

* Using handlebars and express, create a route called `/icecream/:name`. When the route is hit, it will display the name, price and awesomeness for that specific ice cream.

* Create an `/icecreams` route. It will loop over all the ice creams and display them all to the user.
