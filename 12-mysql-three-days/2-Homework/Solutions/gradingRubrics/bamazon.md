### Statement of completion

Be subjective, grading & feedback should not take more than 5 minutes per assignment.

Student utilized MySql to create a product list that displays to users. When user wants to buy an item, the database updates the amount and shows the user the purchase order costs. If there isn't enough of the product left in stock, the database doesn't fufill the order, and tells the user.

1. **Yes**: Grade will be an A or a B

2. **No**: Grade will be a C

3. **No idea, can't test**: Grade will be a D or F

### Yes (A or B)

If the student's assignment was pristine, give them an A, and an encouraging sentence for feedback.

If the student's assignment had a few areas for improvement, give them a B, and 2 or 3 specific pieces of feedback.

### No (C)

Give the student a C, and 2 or 3 specific pieces of feedback. Invite the student to office hours to go over topics not mastered.

### No idea (D or F)

If the project can't be tested, the student receives a D.

If the student turned in nothing, the student receives an F.

Either way, explain to the student why they received that grade, and invite them to visit office hours for help.
