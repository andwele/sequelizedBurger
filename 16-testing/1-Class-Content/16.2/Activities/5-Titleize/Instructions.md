**Instructions**:

  * Your task is to write tests for a function that title-cases incoming names. For example: `titleize('mr jones')` returns 'Mr Jones'.

  * As an optional bonus, create a dictionary of titles, such as Dr; Mr; Ms; etc. If the string begins with such a title, capitalize it, and append a period.

  * Proceed as with `disemvowel`, considering:

  * What constitutes a "representative expected input"?

  * What is unexpected input? How do you want `titleize` to respond to this?

  * Do you want to allow arbitrarily long names, or impose a cutoff? _Hint_: There's no right answer, here. Choose an implementation, and write a test reflecting your choice.

  * Once you've written your tests, run them, to ensure they fail.

  * Next, start implementing `titleize`. Pass a test at a time.

  * Once you've passed all tests—congratulate yourself!
