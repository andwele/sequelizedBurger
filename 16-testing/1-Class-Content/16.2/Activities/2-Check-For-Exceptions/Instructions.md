**Instructions**:

  * Create a function, called `assertThrows`, which takes an argument called `func`, and calls it as a function.

  * Create another function, called `multiply`, which prints the result of multiply 2 and 2.

  * Use `assertThrows` to call `multiply`.

  * Next, update `multiply` to accept two arguments, `x` and `y`, and returns the result of multiply them.

  * Update `assertThrows` so that it can call `multiply` with two arguments.

  * Ensure everything works by using `assertThrows` to print the result of multiplying two numbers.

  * Next, update `multiply` so that it throws an error if either `x` or `y` is not a number, and returns the result otherwise.

  * Finally, update `assertThrows` such that it prints 'Function threw.' to the console, and returns `true`.
