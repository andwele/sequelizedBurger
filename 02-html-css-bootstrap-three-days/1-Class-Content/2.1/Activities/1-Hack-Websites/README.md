#"Hacking" Websites
	
* For the next 15 minutes, take a website that you commonly use (Amazon, Google, Huff Po, etc.) and heavily modify it using the Google Developer Tools.

* Be sure to at least modify:

  * Content (Change words)
  * Colors
  * Spacing
  * Etc.

* Send a screenshot to the class’ slack profile when you’re done.
