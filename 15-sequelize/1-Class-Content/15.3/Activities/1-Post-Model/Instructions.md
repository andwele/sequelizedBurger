**INSTRUCTIONS**:

  The goal of this exercise is to create a Post model using Sequelize.

  1) Open the 1-Post-Model/UNSOLVED folder, run `npm install`

  2) Create a new MySQL database and name it `blogger`. Don't create any tables.

  3) Open the `config` folder and update the `config.json` file's `development` object to match your own local MySQL database.

  4) Go to the `models` folder and open the `post.js` file.

  5) Create a Sequelize `Post` model here. The model should have a title property of type DataTypes.STRING, a body property of DataTypes.TEXT, and a category property of DataTypes.STRING. 
  (<http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/v3/api/datatypes/>)

  6) To check if this worked, run `node server` in your terminal. Then open MySQL Workbench to check if a Posts table has been created.

  **Note**: We still have some code to add in the next exercise to get this app fully functioning, just concentrate on creating the Post model and verifying that you were successful for now.

  **BONUS**

  If you complete the activity before time's up, try adding the following:

  1) Flags to the title and body to prevent NULL values from being entered.

  2) A validation to the title so that it must be between 1 and 160 characters.

  3) A validation to the body so that it must be at least 1 character long.

  4) A flag to the category so that it has a default value of "Personal" if a value is not supplied.
