**INSTRUCTIONS**:

  The goal of this exercise is to add Sequelize CRUD methods inside each route specified in the comments in the api-routes.js file.

  1) Open the 2-Blog-CRUD/UNSOLVED folder, run `npm install`

  2) Open the `config` folder and update the `config.json` file's `development` object to match your own local MySQL database.

  3) Navigate to the `api-routes.js` file inside of the `routes` folder.

  4) Fill in each route with the code described in the comments to add each CRUD action.

* We can test our code works by checking to see if we have the following functionality (recommended order):

  * Create a new post
  * Get a list of all posts
    * Get a list of all posts of a category
    * Edit a post
    * Delete a post

* **If things aren't working as expected, check to see if any errors logged to the terminal.**
